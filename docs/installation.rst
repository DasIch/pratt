Installation
============

Pratt is available on the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_ and can be installed
easily with pip_. Installation should preferrably happen in an activated
`virtual environment`_ using::

        pip install pratt

Once pip has successfully installed the package, you should be able to import
the pratt module using ``python -m pratt`` on the command line or
``import pratt`` in a Python REPL.
